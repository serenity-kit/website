## How can I change my password?

Currently this is not possible. Please send us an email to hi@serenity.re and we will prioretise the feature.

## How can I reset my password?

In the future we plan to add recovery system based on a recovery token that will also allow you to reset your password.

That said we will never be able to reset your password in case you loose your recovery token. This is by design and is a tradeoff we make to ensure that your data is safe.
