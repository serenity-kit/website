# Early Access

You can sign up by visiting [https://www.serenityapp.page/](https://www.serenityapp.page/).

Alternatively you can sign up directly in the iOS, macOS or Windows app.

## Intro

This is an early beta. Please let us know if you find any bugs or have any suggestions and send them directly to Nik at nik@serenity.re.

You can create as many workspaces as you want and invite as many people as you want. There are no limits.

## Platforms

### Web Interface

The web interface is available at [https://app.serenityapp.page/](https://app.serenityapp.page/).

### macOS App

You can directly download the macOS App from [https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/actions/runs/9077063504/artifacts/1500493257](https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/actions/runs/9077063504/artifacts/1500493257).

You need to unpack the ZIP file. In there you find `darwin/arm` and `darwin/x64`. In case you have an Intel Mac please use the `darwin/x64` version. In case you have an Apple Silicon Mac please use the `darwin/arm` version.

### Windows App

You can directly download the Windows App from [https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/actions/runs/9077063504/artifacts/1500493258](https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/actions/runs/9077063504/artifacts/1500493258).

### iOS

To install the iOS App you first need to install Apple's [TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) App from the App Store.

We moved to a new Apple Developer Account and need to wait for the review. The link should be available after 2024-05-16 again.

{/* After wars you can download the Serenity App with this link [https://testflight.apple.com/join/OwLGz0Cz](https://testflight.apple.com/join/OwLGz0Cz). */}
