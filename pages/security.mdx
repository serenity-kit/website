# Security

We take security seriously.

## Audits

The last audit of the fully open source [Serenity codebase](https://github.com/serenity-kit/serenity) was performed in 2023-12 by [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/). All concerns have been addressed and the audit report will be available here in 2024-01.

The last audit of the our [opaque](https://github.com/serenity-kit/opaque/) and [react-native-opaque](https://github.com/serenity-kit/react-native-opaque) libraries was performed in 2023-11 by [7ASecurity](https://7asecurity.com/).

## End-to-end Encryption

The following content is encrypted and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient:

- Page
- Page title
- Comment
- Comment reply
- Folder name
- Workspace name
- Workspace avatar

### Meta data

While all the content is encrypted, the server and someone being able to monitor your network traffic can still see a lot of meta data e.g. the size of the encrypted content, the time you sent it, the time you retrieved new content, members of a workspace, your device list.

In addition email addresses are stored in plain text in the database.

### Technical documentation

In case you are interested there is a detailed [technical documentation](https://serenity-documentation.netlify.app/) available that describes the protocols used and links to the relevant code.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
